# 🏗️ Architecture Overview - Backup Automation Tool

## 🎯 Objective

To design a modular, reliable, and maintainable backup automation system that:
- Creates compressed backups of files/folders
- Names them with timestamps or user-defined names
- Uploads them securely to AWS S3
- Logs all activities
- Supports easy future expansion (e.g., email alerts, scheduling)

## ⚙️ Data Flow Explanation

1. **User Input** via `main.py`:

   * Source folder path
   * Compression type (`zip`, `tar.gz`, etc.)
   * Backup file name or auto-timestamp
   * Upload to S3: `yes` or `no`

2. **Backup Creation**:

   * Uses `compressor.py` to compress source
   * Stores backup in `backups/`

3. **S3 Upload**:

   * If enabled, `s3_uploader.py` uploads to a configured AWS S3 bucket

4. **Logging**:

   * All actions (start time, end time, file size, status) logged via `logger.py`

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack

| Component     | Technology                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Language      | Python 3.10+                   |
| Cloud Storage | AWS S3                         |
| Compression   | `shutil`, `tarfile`, `zipfile` |
| Logging       | Python `logging`               |
| Testing       | `unittest`, `pytest`           |
| CI/CD Ready   | GitHub Actions (planned)       |

## 🔒 Security Considerations

* AWS credentials are not hardcoded; use `.env` or AWS CLI profiles
* Future support for encrypted backups (e.g., AES) is planned

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

| Feature             | Status     |
| ------------------- | ---------- |
| Scheduling via Cron | ⏳ Planned  |
| Email notifications | ⏳ Planned  |
| Web dashboard view  | ⏳ In R\&D  |
| Encrypted backups   | ✅ Optional |
