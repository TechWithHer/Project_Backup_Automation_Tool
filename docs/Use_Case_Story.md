## 🧑‍💼 Case Study 1: Backup Automation for a Small Business Owner

**Client**: Owner of a digital marketing agency (Singapore)

**Problem**:
The client handled creative project files across multiple clients but lacked an organized backup system. Every week, they manually copied folders, leading to:
- Missed backups
- Overwritten data
- No off-site storage in case of hardware failure

**Solution Implemented**:
- Setup `Backup Automation Tool`
- Selected folders were auto-zipped with a timestamp
- Files uploaded directly to AWS S3
- Logs maintained in a local `logs/` folder
- Weekly schedule via system cron job

**Result**:
- Backup became a 1-click process
- Peace of mind due to offsite storage
- Logs available for verification
- Time saved: ~ 2 hours/week

**Client Feedback**:
> “This tool gave me peace of mind. I recommend it to every freelancer and small team.”
